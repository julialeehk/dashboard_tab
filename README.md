# Productivity Dashboard 

This is a dashboard website inspired by the Momentum app. You can see the time, weather, location, to-do list, and an inspirational quote. <br />
You'll see a new background image and inspirational quote every time, as they are randomized. <br />
Finally, you can add a tas to do to-do list and check them off. <br />

# What I learned 

• saving, accessing using local storage with Javascript <br />
• using Weather and Geolocation API <br />
• implementing clock using set intervals function <br />
